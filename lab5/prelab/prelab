    -What do the protocols covered in this lab use port numbers for?
		
	They use port numbers to only allow limited access and identify applications who want to communicate using TCP or UDP protocol.
		
    -Provide the syntax of the nttcp command for both the sender and receiver, which executes the following scenario:

        -A TCP server has IP address 10.0.2.6 and a TCP client has IP address 10.0.2.7,. The TCP server is waiting on port number 2222 for a connection request. The client connects to the server and transmits 2000 bytes to the server, which are sent as four write operations of 500 bytes each. 
		
		Sender:	nttcp -ts -2000 -n4 -p2222 -D 10.0.2.6
		Receiver:	nttcp -rs -2000 -n4 -p2222
		
    -Answer the following questions on Path MTU Discovery:
        -How does TCP decide the maximum size of a TCP segment?
		
		PMTU discovery is described in RFC1191. When a connection is established, the two hosts involved exchange their TCP maximum segment size (MSS) values. The smaller of the two MSS values is used for the connection.
		The MSS for a system is usually the MTU at the link layer minus 40 bytes for the IP and TCP headers.
		That is defined as the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) on the network segment. Since TCP/IP is routed through many different segment, you get path MTU: the maximum size an IP packet on a specific path. 
		If the packet is LARGER that this value, it will be fragmented by the router. Now, there is a flag that can be set to tell routers "do not fragment packet" and it is mainly used in path MTU discovery (see below).
		Path MTU discovery will tell you what the path MTU is. It is simply done as follow: send ICMP packets with the "do not fragment" flag set and, as long as you receive and answer, increase the packet size. Once you've got a "Must fragment but Do Not Fragment flag set" answer, you know the path MTU.
		
        -How does UDP decide the maximum size of a UDP datagram?
		
		The maximum size of a UDP diagram cannot exceed 65508, according to experimental results.
		
        -What is the ICMP error generated by a router when it needs to fragment a datagram with the DF bit set? Is the MTU of the interface that caused the fragmentation also returned?
		
		ICMP Network Unreachable. No, the MTU of the next is returned.
		
        -Explain why a TCP connection over an Ethernet segment never runs into problems with fragmentation. 
		
		TCP avoids fragmentation in this way: when a TCP connection is established, the sender and receiver negotiates the maximum segment size (MSS), so that no fragmentation occurs at their outgoing interfaces. The smaller value is used for the MSS.
		
    -Assume a TCP sender receives an ACK in which the acknowledgment number is set to 34567 and the window size is set to 2048. Which sequence numbers can the sender transmit? 
	
	34568 to 36615.
