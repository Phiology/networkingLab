    DESCRIPTION
           "The state of this TCP connection.

            The only value that may be set by a management station is
            deleteTCB(12).  Accordingly, it is appropriate for an agent
            to return a `badValue' response if a management station
            attempts to set this object to any other value.

            If a management station sets this object to the value
            deleteTCB(12), then the TCB (as defined in [RFC793]) of
            the corresponding connection on the managed node is
            deleted, resulting in immediate termination of the
            connection.

            As an implementation-specific option, a RST segment may be
            sent from the managed node to the other TCP endpoint (note,
            however, that RST segments are not sent reliably)."
