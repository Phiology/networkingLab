                    forwarding(1),    -- acting as a router

    DESCRIPTION
           "The indication of whether this entity is acting as an IPv4
            router in respect to the forwarding of datagrams received
            by, but not addressed to, this entity.  IPv4 routers forward
            datagrams.  IPv4 hosts do not (except those source-routed
            via the host).

            When this object is written, the entity should save the
            change to non-volatile storage and restore the object from
            non-volatile storage upon re-initialization of the system.
            Note: a stronger requirement is not used because this object
            was previously defined."
